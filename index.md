I have identified the following tools as essential for the profile of an IT technologist.

- [Github](https://github.com/zpz) for open-source projects or code samples.
- [A web site]({{ site.baseurl }}) for blogs, portfolios, and any other writings and demonstrations.
  (You are looking at this thing of mine, hosted by
  [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com). This is most flexible.
  The blogs are real work; others are mostly pointers and demonstrations.)
- [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/zpz), with a maintained profile. (This is mostly static demonstration, with occasional self-promotion
like announcing a new blog post.)
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ZepuZhang), for staying up to date with topics of my interest. (For me this is mainly "receiving" info.)

I make use of each of these tools to some extent.
