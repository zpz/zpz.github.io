I have identified the following tools as essential to an IT technologist.

- [Github](https://github.com/zpz) for open-source projects or code samples.
- [A personal web-site]({{ site.baseurl }}) with blogs, portfolios, and any other writings or demonstrations.
  (You are looking at mine, hosted by [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com).)
- [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/zpz) for a mostly static but *maintained* profile,
with occasional self-promotion like announcing a new blog post.
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ZepuZhang) for staying up to date with topics and trends of my interest.

I make use of each of these tools to some extent.
I feel this is a really versatile and effective combination.
