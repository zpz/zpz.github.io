[Part 1 of this mini-series](https://zpz.github.io/blog/python-docker-stack-1/) and [Part 2]() of this mini-series have gaven an overview of my Docker stack for Python projects and examined the image building process. In this post, I'll dive into the container-running part of the stack. This part is mostly specific to Python.<!--excerpt-->


That's all for this post. Please read the other parts:

1. [Part 1](https://zpz.github.io/blog/python-docker-stack-1/): overview.
2. [Part 2]((https://zpz.github.io/blog/python-docker-stack-2/)): building images.
3. Part 3: running containers (this article).
4. Part 4: building images for a separately installable Python package. (In contrast, the images built in "Part 2" do not provide a separately installable package. In order to use the Python package therein, one needs to use these images as base image.)
